# Test.API.Client — Advance Design API Sample

A minimal **C# .NET 8 console application** showing how to drive [Advance Design](https://www.graitec.com/advance-design/) programmatically through its HTTP API.

The samples creates strucutrees in new models, call climatic loads autogeneration, creates analysis and retrives results — all without opening the Advance Design UI.

---

## Available Samples

The project includes several samples demonstrating different API capabilities. Select a sample from the menu when you run the application.

### 1. Analysis results: 4-column slab support Fz verification (Europe, 1% tol)

**File:** `PortalFrame4ColumnsSlabSupportFzVerification.cs`

Creates a Europe-localized model with 4 columns (C25/30, R20*30, 5m height), a 10m × 11m planar slab (0.20m thick) at Z=5m, 4 rigid point supports at column bases, a live load family with one planar load (Fz=-30 kN/m²), and a dead load family. Runs analysis and verifies that the sum of support Fz reactions on the live load case matches the applied slab load (Fz × area) within 1% tolerance.

**File:** `Portal2DStructureAndClimaticGeneration.cs`

Extended version of the previous sample with multiple roof elements to demonstrate climatic load distribution across complex roof geometries.

### 8. Intentional error testing: Structure with intentional material error

**File:** `StructureWithIntentionalMaterialError.cs`

Demonstrates error handling by intentionally creating a structure with an invalid material reference, showing how to catch and handle API errors gracefully.

### 9. Properties setting and model management: Custom properties set and verification after reopen

**File:** `CustomPropertiesVerificationOnReopen.cs`

Creates a structure, sets custom properties on elements, saves the project, reopens it, and verifies that the custom properties were persisted correctly.

![Custom properties verification](Docs/CustomPropsVerificationOrReopen.png)

### 10. 3 story slabs on columns

**File:** `BigTestSampleWMostAPIFunctions.cs`

Creates a multi-story structure with slabs on columns, demonstrating complex model assembly with multiple levels.

### 11. Big sample testing most API functions

**File:** `BigTestSampleWMostAPIFunctions.cs`

Comprehensive sample exercising most of the API surface: materials, sections, linear and planar elements, supports, loads, load cases, combinations, analysis, and result retrieval.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| **Advance Design 2027** installed and redistributables | The API server (`AD.API.Srv.exe`) ships with the product. At least build 2027.0.22035). Microsoft Access Database Engine 2016 Redistributable recommended https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54920|
| **.NET 8 SDK** | `dotnet --version` must be ≥ 8.0. |
| Environment variables set | See the table below if they aren't defined already in launchSettings.json |

---

## Dependency

This project references the `AD.API.ClientHost` dll which is in the Advance Design binary path(AD_API_SERVER_BINARY_PATH), which contains the generated HTTP client and session manager. The client assembly is not strongly named, so we reference it as a project dependency rather than a NuGet package.

---

### Environment Variables

The project ships with a `Properties/launchSettings.json` that sets **default values** for all three variables. When you run the project from Visual Studio or the `dotnet run` CLI the defaults are picked up automatically.

Override them with your own paths either:
- in `Properties/launchSettings.json` or removing them from this json or deleting the json and setting them using the following 2 methods,  
- in **Settings → System → Advanced system settings → Environment Variables → User variables**, or
- from a PowerShell terminal (take effect after restarting your terminal / IDE):

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
    "AD_API_SERVER_BINARY_PATH",
    "C:\Program Files\Graitec\Advance Design\2027\Bin\",
    "User")

[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
    "AD_MODELS_PATH",
    "C:\ProgramData\Graitec\Advance Design\2027\Projects\",
    "User")

[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
    "AD_API_SERVER_URL",
    "http://localhost:52000/",
    "User")
```

| Variable | Default value | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `AD_API_SERVER_BINARY_PATH` | `C:\Program Files\Graitec\Advance Design\2027\Bin\` | Folder that contains `AD.API.Srv.exe`. The client will start the server automatically if it is not already running. |
| `AD_MODELS_PATH` | `C:\ProgramData\Graitec\Advance Design\2027\Projects\` | Directory where new project files are created. |
| `AD_API_SERVER_URL` | `http://localhost:52000/` | Base URL of a **already-running** API server. If the server is not reachable at this URL the client starts a new one from `AD_API_SERVER_BINARY_PATH`. |

> **Developer tip:** Point `AD_API_SERVER_BINARY_PATH` to your local build output (e.g. `C:\Sources\ADrepos\DevAD\ServerX64\bin\`) to test against a freshly compiled server.

---

## Build & Run

```bash
# from the repository root
dotnet build Applications/API/Test.API.Client/Test.API.Client.csproj

dotnet run --project Applications/API/Test.API.Client/Test.API.Client.csproj
```

Or open `Applications/API/API.sln` in Visual Studio 2022, set `Test.API.Client` as the startup project, and press **F5**.

The console will print per-step results. Press **Enter** at the end to close.

## Project Structure

```
Test.API.Client/
├── Program.cs                                   # Entry point + shared helpers
├── Portal2DStructureAndClimaticGeneration.cs    # Sample scenario (see below)
└── Properties/
    └── launchSettings.json                      # Default environment variables
```

### `Program.cs` — Entry point

Key sections:

| Section | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `GetEnvironmentVariable` helper | Checks Process → User → Machine scopes in order. |
| Assembly resolver | Registered at startup; probes `AD_API_SERVER_BINARY_PATH` for managed assemblies that the CLR cannot find through default probing. |
| Server auto-start | If the API server is not reachable at `AD_API_SERVER_URL`, `CSessionManager.StartNewSessionAsync` launches `AD.API.Srv.exe` and waits up to 10 s. |
| Sample dispatch | Calls one of the `Sample_*` methods. Uncomment / add calls to run other scenarios. |
| Diagnostic helpers | `PrintResultDetails`, `DumpError`, `DiagText` — reuse these in your own samples. |

### `Portal2DStructureAndClimaticGeneration.cs` — Sample scenario

Demonstrates the **full create → analyse → read-back** loop:

1. `NewProject` — create a project in the models folder.
2. `CreateMaterial` — S235 steel + C25/30 concrete.
3. `CreateSection` — IPE400 catalogue section.
4. `CreateElement` (×4) — columns and roof beam forming a portal frame with `ClimaticLE2D = true`.
5. `CreateElement` (×2) — rigid punctual supports at the column bases.
6. `CreateLoadCaseFamily` + `CreateLoadCase` — IBC wind & snow families with multiple wind-direction and snow load cases.
7. `ClimaticAutoGeneration` — auto-generates loads from the climatic definition.
8. `GetElements` + `GetElement` — reads back generated loads and prints them.

## How to Add Your Own Sample

1. Add a new `partial class Program` file, e.g. `MySample.cs`:

```csharp
namespace Test.API.Client
{
    internal partial class Program
    {
        static void Sample_MySample(AD.API.ClientHost.AD_Client client)
        {
            // your code here
            var resp = client.NewProject("C:\\Temp\\MySample\\", new Environments
            {
                Language = AD.API.ClientHost.Language_Code.ELanguageEnglish,
                LogVerbosity = AD.API.ClientHost.LogVerboseLevel.Errors
            });
            PrintResultDetails(resp.Details, LogVerboseLevel.Errors, "New project");
            // ...
            client.CloseProject();
        }
    }
}
```

2. In `Program.cs`, inside `thread1`'s body, replace (or add) the sample call:

```csharp
Sample_MySample(client);
```

3. Run the project — your sample executes and prints results to the console.

---

## API Response Pattern

Every `AD_Client` method returns an `ApiResponse` wrapper. Always check:

```csharp
var resp = client.CreateMaterial(new Material { Name = "S235" });

if (!resp.Details.Success || resp.Details.HasErrors)
{
    // resp.Details.Diagnostics contains structured error messages
    PrintResultDetails(resp.Details, LogVerboseLevel.Errors, "CreateMaterial");
    return;
}

EID materialId = resp.Data; // the created object's ID
```

| Property | Type | Meaning |
|----------|------|---------|
| `Details.Success` | `bool` | `true` when no error-level diagnostics occurred |
| `Details.HasErrors` | `bool` | `true` if any error diagnostic is present |
| `Details.HasWarnings` | `bool` | `true` if any warning is present |
| `Details.Diagnostics` | `ICollection<DiagnosticEntry>` | Structured list of messages |
| `Data` | varies | The payload (`EID`, list, `bool`, etc.) |
